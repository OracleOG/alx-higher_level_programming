using ``matrix_divided`` module
==============================

importing the ``matrix_divided`` function:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

matrix of two list all are numbers and equal size
>>> matrix1 = [[1,2,3], [2,3,4]]

matrix of two list but unequal size
>>> matrix2 = [[2,4,5], [2,3]]

matrix of two lists but containing a character
>>> matrix3 = [[4,'s',5], [4,4,5]]

matrix of a single list containing None
>>> matrix4 = [[None]]

matrix of a single list containing numbers
>>> matrix5 = [[1,4,6]]

matrix  of two lists containing None, a number and a character
>>> matrix6 = [[None], [2,2,'a']]

divide matrix1 with 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix1, 2)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [1.0, 1.5, 2.0]]
